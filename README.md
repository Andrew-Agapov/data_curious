Hello, my name is Andriy.
I am a seasoned marketing professional with extensive marketing and analytics background. I am studying Data Science and Python and applying my knowledge to explore data which I find interesting.
I am testing my data scientist skills here, and would welcome feedback, as I have only started doing Python for Data Science

TABLE OF CONTENTS:

#1: CA_Labour_data_analysis_imm_nonimm.py -- exploratory analysis of Open Data from Canadian government on Labour force characteristics of immigrants by sex and age group, three-month moving average, unadjusted for seasonality (2006-2021).
This python script uses numpy, pandas and matplotlib.pylot packages. It also uses file 14100084.csv for analysis. CSV file is also available at https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/ae01fd0c-7f86-4d49-8ea3-84834ccdc3b7
