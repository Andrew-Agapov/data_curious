Hello, my name is Andriy.
I am a seasoned marketing professional with extensive marketing and analytics background. I am studying Data Science and Python and applying my knowledge to explore data which I find interesting.
I am testing my data scientist skills here, and would welcome feedback, as I have only started doing Python for Data Science
